# Token Linktree: The Universal Directory for Token Information

## Executive Summary

### The Problem
In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, token information is fragmented across multiple platforms and chains. Users struggle to find official resources and verified information, while token projects lack a standardized way to share multi-chain information. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies, increased risk of scams, and barriers to adoption.

### Our Solution
Token Linktree is a decentralized, multi-chain directory for token information. Our platform provides:
- An easy-to-use interface for creating and managing token information
- Cross-chain compatibility, starting with Ethereum and expanding to other major networks
- Blockchain-verified authenticity to ensure trust and reliability
- Seamless integration with existing token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.)

By leveraging the ERC-7738 standard for permissionless script registry, Token Linktree creates a unified, trustworthy source of information for all tokens across multiple blockchains.

### Market Opportunity
The cryptocurrency market cap stands at $1.5 trillion as of 2023, with over 20,000 active cryptocurrencies. The growing demand for cross-chain interoperability and reliable information presents a significant opportunity.
